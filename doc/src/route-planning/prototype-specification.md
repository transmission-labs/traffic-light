# Specification (prototype)

Whilst we've tried to make the documentation engaging and accessible, this is most likely "the boring part", unless you're especially interested in the minutiae and have a very strong technical foundation, you would be forgiven for skipping this.

This is the _prototype_ specification, the emphasis will be more on learning and implementation speed and less on correctness and safety.

_work in progress_
