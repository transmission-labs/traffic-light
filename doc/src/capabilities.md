# Capabilities

## Distributed route planning

**Hypothesis:** vehicles on the road are in a position to gather information about their surroundings, sharing that information with other road users would allow them to plan more efficient routes than would otherwise be possible.

## Drafting

**Hypothesis:** enabling two vehicles to communicate would allow them to safely drive very close together, maximising fuel efficiency and enabling all vehicles in a group to travel at the top speed of the fastest vehicle.

## Distributed object detection

**Hypothesis:** vehicles on the road are in a position to gather information about their surroundings, sharing that information with other road users would allow them to detect and interpret the actions of objects more reliably than relying only on their own sensors. This would lead to fewer accidents, especially with cyclists.

## Junction negotiation

**Hypothesis:** if vehicles didn't have to stop at traffic lights, the throughput of the road network would be increased leading to shorter journey times. Technology could allow vehicles to negotiate safe passage through a junction without stopping.
