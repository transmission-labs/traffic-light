The only way to satisfactorily test `traffic-light` is to install it in enough vehicles and see if it does something sensible in realistic traffic conditions. For some features, it may be possible to do this with a mobile app and humans rather than waiting for self driving cars to land in a city near you. There aren't currently any plans to do this as part of the project.

The next best thing is simulation. The quality of the feedback rises with the quality of the simulator so a significant amount of the investment in this project may be spent on simulation.
